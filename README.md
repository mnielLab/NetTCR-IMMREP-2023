# NetTCR-IMMREP-2023
 This repository contains the models and predictions used for the NetTCR entries for the [IMMREP 2023 Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tcr-specificity-prediction-challenge/overview).

## Environment setup with conda
First, ensure that miniconda/anaconda is installed (see `https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/` for more info).

Following this, the conda environment for NetTCR-2.2 can be installed by running `conda env create -f environment.yml` from the `NetTCR-2.2` folder. This will create a conda environment called `nettcr_2_2_env` with the necessary dependencies.

To load this environment afterwards in commandline, run the command `conda activate nettcr_2_2_env`.
